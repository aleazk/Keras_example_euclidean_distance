# Keras_example_euclidean_distance

A simple example showing how to use Keras to make a neural network learn if the euclidean distance to the origin of a 
given array of 10 integers is less or equal to 15. Both the dimension of the space and the given distance can be changed, of course.
The input data is generated randomly.
We don't claim too much efficiency nor accuracy, just a simple example of the use of some NumPy and Keras essential tools.

You can use this as a source of examples for testing my other repository here, called pienex.
